# AngularjsFeGenaiPlgrnd

## Project Description

This is a draft pet project for testing Generative AI on different software engineering tasks. It is planned to evolve and grow over time. Specifically, this repo will be a Angular playground.
For now, we only have the:
[Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rtriska/ruby_be_genai_plgrnd),
[PHP](https://github.com/rtriska/php_be_genai_plgrnd),
[Java](https://github.com/rtriska/java_be_genai_plgrnd),
[.Net](https://github.com/rtriska/net_be_genai_plgrnd)
applications as a Back-End, but we plan to extend it to other technologies in the future.
This application can be started with a `docker compose` using the Back-End applications mentioned.

The application's legend is based on the sports-hub application description from the following repo: [Sports-Hub](https://github.com/dark-side/sports-hub).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Dependencies

- Rancher

You can install Rancher Desktop by following the [Installation Guide](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/#macos)

Ensure to select "docker (moby)" for docker-compose compatibility

In case of compatibility issues Administrative Access might be required: Rancher Desktop -> Preferences -> Application -> Administrative Access

## Setup and Running the Application

### Clone the Repositories

To run the web application with the back-end, clone the following repository within the same folder:

```sh
Ruby
git clone git@github.com:rtriska/ruby_be_genai_plgrnd.git

PHP
git clone git@github.com:rtriska/php_be_genai_plgrnd.git

Java
git clone git@github.com:rtriska/java_be_genai_plgrnd.git

.Net
git clone git@github.com:rtriska/net_be_genai_plgrnd.git
```

### Change Frontend

In docker-compose.yml at the back-end application directory change the front-end directory to the current one:

```sh
  frontend:
    build: ../angularjs_fe_genai_plgrnd <--- Here
    depends_on:
      - backend
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    restart: always
    <<: *frontend-variables
```

### Run Docker Compose

Navigate to the back-end application directory and run:

```sh
docker compose up
```
